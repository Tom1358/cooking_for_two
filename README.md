Cooking For Two

Cooking is a hobby and necessity that can be challenging to fit into a busy lifestyle.  This website will aim to help give new ideas to two-person households (or could be doubled-up for a four-person household) and serve as a repository – essentially a personalised online cooking book – that users can upload new recipes to, modify or delete these new recipes, and buy the necessary kitchen equipment needed to cook the recipes.

The live website can be viewed here.
