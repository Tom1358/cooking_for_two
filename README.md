# Cooking For Two

Cooking is a hobby and necessity that can be challenging to fit into a busy lifestyle.  This website will aim to help give new ideas to two-person households (or could be doubled-up for a four-person household) and serve as a repository – essentially a personalised online cooking book – that users can upload new recipes to, modify or delete these new recipes, and buy the necessary kitchen equipment needed to cook the recipes.

## UX
User Stories

As a user of the site, I want:
- to be able to easily view a range of dishes and their recipes.
- to clearly understand the layout of the website and move about easily.
- to be able to view the website on any device for convenience (e.g. on the user's phone while cooking)
- to be able to create my own recipes on the website and store them there.

As an administrator of the site, I want:
- to be able to update or delete any recipe on the site, to allow quality control.

As a business owner of the site, I want:
- users to sign up to the website to encourage them to use it more often.
- users who are registered and signed in to easily create recipes and use the site, thus encouraging repeat visits.
- users to be encouraged, but not pushed, to visit the shop page to buy items through the website.

## Structure

- 'More' button on individual dish cards leads to Recipe page
</details><br>

<details>

### Surface 
#### Colour and Styling 
I originally planned to use [this logo](static/images/logo.png) but eventually decided that the photo-image used on the final website fitted better and looked more professional.  However, the colour theme from this logo was used for the theme of the website, with this [colour palette](static/images/colour_scheme.png) being used with the following colours to give an earthy-theme to the site:
- #E88468 - pastel red
- #577590 - pastel blue
- #9FB37F - pastel green
- #EAC576 - pastel yellow
- #583B23 - dark brown
- black and white where necessary for maximum contrast

## Deployment

### Application Hosting

The site is hosted using Heroku, deployed from the master branch of GitHub, and updates automatically as new commits are pushed.  

To create a Heroku app:
- From heroku.com, sign in to your account (or create a new one if needed).
- Select 'new' and '[create new app](static/deployment/No1.PNG)'
- Select '[deploy to GitHub](static/deployment/No2.PNG)' and select your repository and project name.  Select `connect`.

### Environmental variables:
- In the terminal window of your IDE, type in:

    `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt` (this creates a file with the required modules for Heroku)
    `python3 app.py > Procfile` (this creates a file that tells Heroku how to launch the app)
    touch .gitignore (creates file including the files/ directories to be excluded from live development)

- Ensure that your `env.py` file is listed in this .gitignore file.
- `env.py` should include the following:

        import os
        os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
        os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
        os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "")
        os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "")
        os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "")
- For the final 3 variables, these should be unique identifiers to your project, which will be aligned with the Heroku variables (see below).

- Back on the Heroku dashboard, select `settings` and '[config vars](static/deployment/No3.PNG)'
- Fill in these [environment variables](static/deployment/No4.PNG) from your `env.py` file

### MongoDB

- Sign in or register with MongoDB at mongodb.com.
- Create a cluster, then a database.
- Within this database, create as many collections needed - these would be groups of information, e.g. `users` for one collection, `dishes` for another, `categories` for another.
- Within each collection, add values required.  These can be various types of information, e.g. strings/ arrays, dictionaries.
